All of my code will comply with the style rules listed in the style rules.

The "testing" branch of this repository will be for my personal use (syncing
work between machines, tracking my changes) while the "master" branch will
contain only completed work. 

My indendation will follow the Allman Style.

In general, my comments will be formatted thusly: Above all functions there
will be a multiline comment detailing the spec of the function. This comment
will contain, at minimum, the list of input arguments and the significance
(if any) of the return value. For sufficiently complex functions this comment
will also contain information about the algorithm implemented.
